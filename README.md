# chalet-example-modules

This repository showcases how to setup a [Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space) project with C++20 modules -- so far just with MSVC on Windows. 

To get started, [download Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space/download), check out some of the documentation for it, and either build with the various commands from the command line, or try out the [Chalet VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chalet-org.vscode-chalet) (recommended).


### Debugging

* For Windows: Install the C/C++ extension and Build with MSVC and use the "MSVC" configuration
